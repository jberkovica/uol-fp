-   Established this progress tracking document to record development history

#### 3. Set up backend foundation

-   Created backend directory structure with FastAPI framework
-   Established the following services:
    -   Image analysis service (using Google Gemini Vision)
    -   Story generation service (using Google Gemini Pro)
    -   Text-to-speech service (using Google Cloud TTS)
-   Implemented main API endpoints:
    -   `/upload-image/` - Handles image uploads from children

## Project Architecture Reorganization & Authentication Migration

#### Major Project Restructuring

##### Directory Structure Flattening
- **Reorganized project structure** from nested to flat architecture:
  ```
  Before:                     After:
  app/                       backend/        (FastAPI backend)
  ├── backend/           →   app/            (Flutter frontend)  
  └── mira_storyteller/      .env            (consolidated config)
  ```
- **Moved models_analysis** to separate project (`../models_analysis`)
- **Eliminated nested app/** directory for cleaner structure
- **Preserved git history** using proper `git mv` operations (367 files reorganized)

##### Environment Configuration Consolidation
- **Single source of truth**: Consolidated all `.env` files into root directory
- **Removed duplicate environment files** from backend and frontend subdirectories
- **Updated all code paths** to load from root `.env` file:
  - Backend Python: `load_dotenv('../.env')` and `load_dotenv('../../.env')`
  - Flutter app: Symbolic link approach `app/.env -> ../.env`
- **Maintained security**: No environment duplication, single configuration file

##### Database Connection Resolution
- **Fixed Supabase connection issues** caused by IPv4/IPv6 compatibility
- **Diagnosed DNS resolution failure** for direct connection hostname
- **Switched to Session pooler** from Direct connection as recommended by Supabase docs:
  - Direct: `db.project.supabase.co` (IPv6 only, causing "Tenant not found" errors)
  - Session: `aws-0-region.pooler.supabase.com` (IPv4/IPv6 compatible, works with SQLAlchemy)
- **Session pooler benefits**: Persistent connections, prepared statements support, ideal for backend servers

#### Frontend Authentication Migration

##### Firebase to Supabase Migration
- **Removed Firebase dependencies** from Flutter app:
  - Eliminated: `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`
  - Added: `supabase_flutter: ^2.8.0`
- **Created Supabase configuration service** (`lib/config/supabase_config.dart`)
- **Implemented comprehensive auth service** (`lib/services/auth_service.dart`) with:
  - Email/password authentication
  - Google OAuth integration
  - Apple OAuth support
  - Password reset functionality
  - Authentication state management

##### Authentication Service Features
```dart
// AuthService capabilities:
- signInWithEmailAndPassword()  // Standard email auth
- signUpWithEmailAndPassword()  // User registration  
- signInWithGoogle()           // Google OAuth
- signInWithApple()            // Apple OAuth
- resetPassword()              // Password recovery
- signOut()                    // Session termination
- authStateChanges             // Real-time auth state
```

##### Configuration Management Best Practices
- **Symbolic link approach**: `app/.env -> ../.env` maintains single source
- **Flutter asset configuration**: Updated `pubspec.yaml` for proper `.env` loading
- **Environment validation**: Added configuration checks in `SupabaseConfig.isConfigured`
- **No duplication**: Avoided creating multiple `.env` files across directories

#### Technical Infrastructure Improvements

##### Project Organization Benefits
- **Simplified development**: Flat structure easier to navigate
- **Reduced complexity**: No nested directory confusion  
- **Better IDE support**: Cleaner project structure in editors
- **Clearer separation**: Backend vs frontend responsibilities obvious

##### Authentication Architecture Alignment
- **Unified auth system**: Both backend and frontend use same Supabase instance
- **Shared credentials**: Single environment configuration for all services
- **Session management**: Consistent authentication state across applications
- **Security consistency**: Same auth policies and validation rules

##### Database Connection Stability
- **Production-ready**: Session pooler designed for persistent applications
- **Better performance**: Connection reuse and prepared statements
- **Network compatibility**: Works with both IPv4 and IPv6 networks
- **Error resolution**: Fixed "Tenant not found" and DNS resolution issues

#### Quality Assurance Results
