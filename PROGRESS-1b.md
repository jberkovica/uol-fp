### Typography System Overhaul & UI Polish

#### 1. Centralized Typography Hierarchy
- **Removed all hardcoded font styles** from screens, enforcing centralized theme system:
  - `displayLarge` (32px, w700) - Main page titles like "Magic is happening.."
  - `displayMedium` (28px, w700) - Secondary titles
  - `headlineLarge` (24px, w700) - Primary section headers like "My tales"
  - `headlineMedium` (20px, w700) - Secondary section headers like "Favourites", "Latest"
  - `headlineSmall` (18px, w700) - Small headers
  - `labelLarge` (16px, w500) - Button text and emphasized labels
  - `bodyLarge/Medium/Small` - Body text with normal weight

#### 2. Enhanced Text Readability
- **Made text colors significantly darker** for better contrast:
  - `textDark`: #3A3A3A → #1F1F1F (much darker for better readability)
  - `textGrey`: #666666 → #4A4A4A (darker subtle grey)
- **Optimized title weight**: Changed from w600 to w700 for better hierarchy without being too bold
- **Fixed button text**: Reduced from w600 to w500 with larger 20px size for better readability

## 🎨 Home Screen UI Redesign - Layered Design Implementation
*July 23, 2025*

### 🎯 Objective
Redesign the home screen upper section to match the design mockup with proper layering: violet cloud, mascot character, and white create button positioned correctly with clean visual hierarchy.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overhaul

#### Stack-Based Layering System
Implemented a robust 3-layer architecture to achieve the desired visual effect:

```dart
Stack(
  children: [
    // Layer 1: Yellow background (bottom)
    Container(color: AppColors.secondary),
    
    // Layer 2: Cloud and mascot (middle) 
    Positioned(...), // Cloud and mascot elements
    
    // Layer 3: White container + UI elements (top)
    Positioned(...), // White container covers lower parts
  ],
)
```

#### Clean Separation of Concerns
- **Background layer**: Pure yellow background filling entire screen
- **Decorative layer**: Cloud and mascot positioned behind white container
- **Content layer**: White container with stories, separate from background elements

### 🎨 Visual Design Implementation

#### Cloud Positioning System
- **Color**: Used exact processing screen color (`Color(0xFFDFBBC6)`) as requested
- **Responsive positioning**: Mobile (-200px), Tablet (-500px), Desktop (-800px)
- **Size**: 1.8x screen width for proper partial visibility
- **Layer**: Positioned behind white container for natural depth

#### Mascot Character Integration  
- **Body**: 160x160px positioned at `left: 20, top: 180`
- **Face**: Changed to `face-1.svg` as requested, positioned at `left: 85, top: 210`
- **Alignment**: Face perfectly centered on mascot body with proper vertical positioning
- **Layer**: Behind white container, on top of yellow background

#### Button System Optimization
- **Create button**: Redesigned to be shorter (120px width) but same height (60px)
- **Positioning**: Right-aligned in yellow section, on top of all elements
- **Style**: White FilledButton with reduced horizontal padding (20px vs 32px)

### 🔧 Technical Solutions

#### Layering Architecture Problem-Solving
**Challenge**: Initial implementation had cloud/mascot appearing on top of white container
**Solution**: Restructured Stack order to place decorative elements before content elements

**Challenge**: White container was part of same widget as yellow background  
**Solution**: Separated into independent layers - yellow background, decorative elements, white container

**Challenge**: Negative margins caused Flutter assertion errors
**Solution**: Used `Transform.translate` for positioning, then ultimately restructured with proper Stack layering

#### Responsive Design Implementation
```dart
double _getResponsiveCloudPosition(BuildContext context) {
  final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
  if (screenWidth < 600) return -200;      // Mobile
  else if (screenWidth < 1200) return -500; // Tablet  
  else return -800;                        // Desktop
}
```

#### Header and Navigation Integration
- **Header positioning**: Moved to positioned element on top of all layers
- **Create button**: Positioned independently with custom styling
- **Navigation**: Maintained bottom navigation bar functionality

### 📱 User Experience Improvements

#### Visual Hierarchy
- **Clean layering**: Yellow → Cloud/Mascot → White container → UI elements
- **Natural depth**: Cloud and mascot appear "behind" white container
- **Consistent spacing**: Proper positioning maintains design integrity

#### Responsive Behavior  
- **Mobile-first design**: Optimized positioning for mobile screens
- **Tablet adaptation**: Cloud repositioned to maintain visual balance
- **Desktop scaling**: Proper cloud positioning for large screens

#### Performance Optimization
- **Efficient rendering**: Stack-based approach with minimal widget rebuilds
- **Asset management**: SVG assets with proper colorFilter application
- **Memory management**: Positioned widgets prevent unnecessary layout calculations

### 🎯 Design System Consistency

#### Color Implementation
- **Exact color matching**: Used `Color(0xFFDFBBC6)` from processing screen

- **Visual consistency**: Colors match established design patterns

#### Typography and Layout
- **Font consistency**: All text uses centralized Manrope font system
- **Spacing system**: Follows 8px grid spacing principles  
- **Component reuse**: Leveraged existing story section and navigation components

### 📊 Code Quality Metrics

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Clean separation**: 3 distinct layers with clear responsibilities
