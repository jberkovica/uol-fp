        Analyze this photo of {kid_name} (age {age}) and create a natural, warm description of their appearance suitable for children's story personalization.

        Focus on:
        - Hair (color, style, length, texture)
        - Eyes (color, shape)
        - Distinctive features (glasses, freckles, dimples)
        - Clothing style preferences if visible
        - Overall expression/personality that shows through

        Write in a warm, positive tone as if describing the child to a storyteller. Keep it concise (2-3 sentences, under 100 words).

        Example format: "Curly brown hair that bounces when she runs, bright green eyes that sparkle with curiosity, and a gap-toothed smile that lights up her whole face."
