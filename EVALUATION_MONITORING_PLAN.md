# Comprehensive Application Evaluation & Monitoring Plan for Mira Storyteller

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for evaluating and monitoring the Mira Storyteller AI-powered children's storytelling application across multiple dimensions: crash tracking, user behavior, performance monitoring, cost tracking, and AI content quality evaluation.

## 1. Crash Monitoring & Error Tracking

### Mobile Apps (iOS/Android): Firebase Crashlytics
**Why Firebase Crashlytics:**
- Free tier with generous limits
- Deep integration with existing Firebase ecosystem
- Mobile-first design for Flutter apps
- Real-time crash reporting and alerts
- Maintained by Google with regular updates

**Implementation:**
- Add Firebase Crashlytics SDK to Flutter app
- Configure automatic crash collection
- Set up custom logging for critical user flows
- Integrate with CI/CD for symbol uploading

**What it tracks:**
- App crashes and exceptions
- Non-fatal exceptions and custom logs
- Device and OS information
- User actions leading to crashes

### Web App: Sentry
**Why Sentry for Web:**
- Firebase Crashlytics does not support web applications
- Excellent Flutter Web integration
- Real-time error tracking and performance monitoring
- Source map support for debugging minified code
- Unified error tracking with backend

**Implementation:**
```dart
// pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  sentry_flutter: ^7.18.0

// lib/main.dart (web-specific initialization)
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  if (kIsWeb) {
    await SentryFlutter.init(
      (options) {
        options.dsn = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN';
        options.environment = kDebugMode ? 'development' : 'production';
        options.tracesSampleRate = 0.1;
      },
      appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
    );
  } else {
    runApp(MyApp());
  }
}
```

**What it tracks:**
- JavaScript/Dart exceptions in web builds
- Performance metrics and Core Web Vitals
- User interactions and navigation
- Network request failures
- Custom events and breadcrumbs

### Backend: Sentry
**Why Sentry for Backend:**
- Excellent Python/FastAPI integration
- Real-time error tracking and performance monitoring
- Advanced error grouping and deduplication
- Release tracking and deployment notifications
- Issue assignment and workflow management

**Implementation:**
```python
# requirements.txt
sentry-sdk[fastapi]==1.45.0

# backend/src/main.py or app.py
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.sqlalchemy import SqlAlchemyIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="YOUR_SENTRY_DSN",
    integrations=[
        FastApiIntegration(auto_enabling_integrations=False),
        SqlAlchemyIntegration(),
    ],
    traces_sample_rate=0.1,  # 10% of transactions for performance monitoring
    environment="production",  # or "development"
    release="1.0.0",  # Track releases
)
```

**Configuration:**
- Add Sentry DSN to environment variables
- Configure error filtering and sampling rates
- Set up release tracking for deployments
- Enable performance monitoring for API endpoints

**What it tracks:**
- Python exceptions and errors
- API endpoint performance and latency
- Database query performance
- Custom events and breadcrumbs
- User context and session information

**Timeline:** Week 1
