    ```

#### 2. Created comprehensive documentation

-   Wrote detailed README.md with project overview, features, tech stack, and setup instructions
-   Established this progress tracking document to record development history

#### 3. Set up backend foundation

-   Created backend directory structure with FastAPI framework
-   Established the following services:
    -   Image analysis service (using Google Gemini Vision)
    -   Story generation service (using Google Gemini Pro)
    -   Text-to-speech service (using Google Cloud TTS)
-   Implemented main API endpoints:
    -   `/upload-image/` - Handles image uploads from children
    -   `/generate-story/` - Processes images and creates stories
    -   `/review-story/` - Enables parent approval workflow
    -   `/story/{story_id}` - Retrieves approved stories

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: File permission issues with Flutter lib directory

**Problem:** The `lib/` directory was listed in the project's .gitignore file, preventing modifications to Flutter app files.
**Solution:** Removed `lib/` from .gitignore to allow Flutter development while maintaining other necessary exclusions.
**Outcome:** Successfully enabled Flutter app development with proper version control integration.

## Implementation Details

    -   Setting/environment recognition
    -   Color scheme analysis
    -   Mood interpretation
    -   Theme suggestion generation

#### Story Generator Service

-   Created `StoryGeneratorService` class using Gemini Pro API
-   Implemented story generation with customizable parameters:
    -   Length options (short, medium, long)

    -   Age-appropriate content filtering (age groups 2-3, 4-6, 7-9)
-   Added structured response handling with JSON parsing

#### Text-to-Speech Service

-   Developed `TextToSpeechService` class using Google Cloud TTS
-   Implemented child-friendly voice configuration with:
    -   Slower speaking rate (0.9x normal speed)
    -   Child-appropriate voice selection
    -   Audio optimization for small device speakers

### Frontend Development

#### Mock Story Service Implementation

-   Created comprehensive `Story` data model with fields for:

    -   ID, title, content, image URL, audio URL, creation date, child name, and status
    -   Defined `StoryStatus` enum (pending, approved, rejected)
    -   Added `DateTimeFormatting` extension for human-readable timestamps

-   Developed singleton `MockStoryService` class simulating backend behavior:
    -   Implemented asynchronous methods with realistic delays
    -   Created streams for real-time updates of pending/approved stories
    -   Added methods for story generation, approval/rejection, and audio simulation
    -   Included predefined mock stories with varied content and statuses

#### App Integration

-   Initialized `MockStoryService` in `main.dart` before app launch
-   Updated route definitions to ensure proper navigation
-   Integrated mock service with `ParentDashboardScreen` to:
    -   Dynamically display pending and approved stories
    -   Handle story approval and rejection workflows
    -   Show appropriate loading states and empty state messages
    -   Navigate to story preview and display screens with data

#### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed route mismatch in child home screen:
    -   Changed incorrect `/processing-screen` route to `/processing` to match main.dart definition
    -   Resolved navigation exception when uploading images
