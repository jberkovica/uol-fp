# Mira Storyteller - Development Progress Log

This document tracks the detailed step-by-step development process of the Mira Storyteller application, including tasks completed, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

## Date: 2025-06-12

### Project Initialization

#### 1. Created project structure

-   Created Flutter application named "mira_storyteller" with `flutter create --org com.mirastoryteller mira_storyteller`
-   Set up directories for backend Python application
    ```
    app/
    ├── mira_storyteller/    # Flutter app
    ├── backend/             # Python backend
    │   ├── app/             # FastAPI application
    │   ├── tests/           # Test files
    │   └── data/            # Data storage
    ├── README.md            # Project documentation
    └── PROGRESS.md          # This development log

### Flutter App Development

### Project Initialization

#### 1. Created project structure

-   Created Flutter application named "mira_storyteller" with `flutter create --org com.mirastoryteller mira_storyteller`
-   Set up directories for backend Python application
    ```
    app/
    ├── mira_storyteller/    # Flutter app
    ├── backend/             # Python backend
    │   ├── app/             # FastAPI application
    │   ├── tests/           # Test files
    │   └── data/            # Data storage
    ├── README.md            # Project documentation
    └── PROGRESS.md          # This development log
    ```

#### 2. Created comprehensive documentation

-   Wrote detailed README.md with project overview, features, tech stack, and setup instructions
-   Established this progress tracking document to record development history

#### 3. Set up backend foundation

-   Created backend directory structure with FastAPI framework
-   Established the following services:
    -   Image analysis service (using Google Gemini Vision)
    -   Story generation service (using Google Gemini Pro)
    -   Text-to-speech service (using Google Cloud TTS)
-   Implemented main API endpoints:
    -   `/upload-image/` - Handles image uploads from children
    -   `/generate-story/` - Processes images and creates stories
    -   `/review-story/` - Enables parent approval workflow
    -   `/story/{story_id}` - Retrieves approved stories

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: File permission issues with Flutter lib directory

**Problem:** The `lib/` directory was listed in the project's .gitignore file, preventing modifications to Flutter app files.
**Solution:** Removed `lib/` from .gitignore to allow Flutter development while maintaining other necessary exclusions.
**Outcome:** Successfully enabled Flutter app development with proper version control integration.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Services

#### Image Analysis Service

-   Implemented `ImageAnalysisService` class to analyze child drawings using Gemini Vision API
-   Added functionality to extract the following elements from images:
    -   Main character identification
    -   Supporting elements detection
    -   Setting/environment recognition
    -   Color scheme analysis
    -   Mood interpretation
    -   Theme suggestion generation

#### Story Generator Service

-   Created `StoryGeneratorService` class using Gemini Pro API
-   Implemented story generation with customizable parameters:
    -   Length options (short, medium, long)
    -   Style variations (bedtime, adventure, educational)
    -   Age-appropriate content filtering (age groups 2-3, 4-6, 7-9)
-   Added structured response handling with JSON parsing

#### Text-to-Speech Service

-   Developed `TextToSpeechService` class using Google Cloud TTS
-   Implemented child-friendly voice configuration with:
    -   Slower speaking rate (0.9x normal speed)
    -   Child-appropriate voice selection
    -   Audio optimization for small device speakers

### Frontend Development

#### Mock Story Service Implementation

- Created comprehensive `Story` data model with fields for:
  - ID, title, content, image URL, audio URL, creation date, child name, and status
  - Defined `StoryStatus` enum (pending, approved, rejected)
  - Added `DateTimeFormatting` extension for human-readable timestamps

- Developed singleton `MockStoryService` class simulating backend behavior:
  - Implemented asynchronous methods with realistic delays
  - Created streams for real-time updates of pending/approved stories
  - Added methods for story generation, approval/rejection, and audio simulation
  - Included predefined mock stories with varied content and statuses

#### App Integration

- Initialized `MockStoryService` in `main.dart` before app launch
- Updated route definitions to ensure proper navigation
- Integrated mock service with `ParentDashboardScreen` to:
  - Dynamically display pending and approved stories
  - Handle story approval and rejection workflows
  - Show appropriate loading states and empty state messages
  - Navigate to story preview and display screens with data

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed route mismatch in child home screen:
  - Changed incorrect `/processing-screen` route to `/processing` to match main.dart definition
  - Resolved navigation exception when uploading images

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

-   Complete the child interface workflow with mock data integration
-   Implement story playback screen with audio controls
-   Add persistence for user preferences and selected profiles

### Planned Features

-   Backend API integration to replace mock services
-   Parent notification system for new stories
-   Enhanced story playback with synchronized audio and text highlighting
-   User profile management for multiple children
