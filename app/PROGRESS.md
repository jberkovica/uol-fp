#### 2. Created comprehensive documentation

-   Wrote detailed README.md with project overview, features, tech stack, and setup instructions
-   Established this progress tracking document to record development history

#### 3. Set up backend foundation

-   Created backend directory structure with FastAPI framework
-   Established the following services:
    -   Image analysis service (using Google Gemini Vision)
    -   Story generation service (using Google Gemini Pro)
    -   Text-to-speech service (using Google Cloud TTS)
-   Implemented main API endpoints:
    -   `/upload-image/` - Handles image uploads from children
    -   `/generate-story/` - Processes images and creates stories
    -   `/review-story/` - Enables parent approval workflow
    -   `/story/{story_id}` - Retrieves approved stories

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: File permission issues with Flutter lib directory

**Problem:** The `lib/` directory was listed in the project's .gitignore file, preventing modifications to Flutter app files.
**Solution:** Removed `lib/` from .gitignore to allow Flutter development while maintaining other necessary exclusions.
**Outcome:** Successfully enabled Flutter app development with proper version control integration.
