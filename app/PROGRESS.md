-   Established this progress tracking document to record development history

#### 3. Set up backend foundation

-   Created backend directory structure with FastAPI framework
-   Established the following services:
    -   Image analysis service (using Google Gemini Vision)
    -   Story generation service (using Google Gemini Pro)
    -   Text-to-speech service (using Google Cloud TTS)
-   Implemented main API endpoints:
    -   `/upload-image/` - Handles image uploads from children
