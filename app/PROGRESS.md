# Mira Storyteller - Development Progress Log

This document tracks the detailed step-by-step development process of the Mira Storyteller application, including tasks completed, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

## Date: 2025-06-12

### Project Initialization

#### 1. Created project structure
- Created Flutter application named "mira_storyteller" with `flutter create --org com.mirastoryteller mira_storyteller`
- Set up directories for backend Python application
  ```
  app/
  ├── mira_storyteller/    # Flutter app
  ├── backend/             # Python backend
  │   ├── app/             # FastAPI application
  │   ├── tests/           # Test files
  │   └── data/            # Data storage
  ├── README.md            # Project documentation
  └── PROGRESS.md          # This development log
  ```

#### 2. Created comprehensive documentation
- Wrote detailed README.md with project overview, features, tech stack, and setup instructions
- Established this progress tracking document to record development history

#### 3. Set up backend foundation
- Created backend directory structure with FastAPI framework
- Established the following services:
  - Image analysis service (using Google Gemini Vision)
  - Story generation service (using Google Gemini Pro)
  - Text-to-speech service (using Google Cloud TTS)
- Implemented main API endpoints:
  - `/upload-image/` - Handles image uploads from children
  - `/generate-story/` - Processes images and creates stories
  - `/review-story/` - Enables parent approval workflow
  - `/story/{story_id}` - Retrieves approved stories

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: File permission issues with Flutter lib directory
**Problem:** The `lib/` directory was listed in the project's .gitignore file, preventing modifications to Flutter app files.
**Solution:** Removed `lib/` from .gitignore to allow Flutter development while maintaining other necessary exclusions.
**Outcome:** Successfully enabled Flutter app development with proper version control integration.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Services

#### Image Analysis Service
- Implemented `ImageAnalysisService` class to analyze child drawings using Gemini Vision API
- Added functionality to extract the following elements from images:
  - Main character identification
  - Supporting elements detection
  - Setting/environment recognition
  - Color scheme analysis
  - Mood interpretation
  - Theme suggestion generation

#### Story Generator Service
- Created `StoryGeneratorService` class using Gemini Pro API
- Implemented story generation with customizable parameters:
  - Length options (short, medium, long)
  - Style variations (bedtime, adventure, educational)
  - Age-appropriate content filtering (age groups 2-3, 4-6, 7-9)
- Added structured response handling with JSON parsing

#### Text-to-Speech Service
- Developed `TextToSpeechService` class using Google Cloud TTS
- Implemented child-friendly voice configuration with:
  - Slower speaking rate (0.9x normal speed)
  - Child-appropriate voice selection
  - Audio optimization for small device speakers

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
- Create Flutter UI components based on existing mockups
