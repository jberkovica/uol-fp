# Technical Challenges in Multi-Model AI Evaluation System

**Project**: MIRA - Multi-modal Image Recognition and Analysis  
**Component**: Image Captioning and Story Generation Evaluation  
**Institution**: University of London Final Project  
**Date**: December 2025

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical challenges encountered during the development of a comprehensive multi-model evaluation system for image captioning and story generation tasks. The system integrates 10+ state-of-the-art AI models across 4 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek) to generate comparative performance data for academic research.

## 1. Model Access and API Integration Challenges

### 1.1 Gemini 2.5 Preview Model Restrictions

**Challenge**: Google's latest Gemini 2.5 preview models exhibited overly restrictive safety filters for children's content generation.

**Technical Details**:

-   Models: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview`, `gemini-2.5-pro-preview`
-   Issue: Safety filters blocked generation of appropriate children's stories
-   Error patterns: Content blocked even for innocent toy descriptions
-   Impact: Unable to include cutting-edge models in comparative analysis

**Resolution**:

-   Excluded Gemini 2.5 preview models from production evaluation
-   Documented findings in `SAFETY_FILTER_INVESTIGATION.md`
-   Used stable Gemini 2.0 and 1.5 models instead
-   Maintained 8 Google model variants for comprehensive coverage

### 1.2 Anthropic API Version Compatibility Crisis

**Challenge**: Critical API compatibility issue with Anthropic Claude models.

**Technical Details**:

-   **Error**: `'Anthropic' object has no attribute 'messages'`
-   **Root Cause**: Outdated anthropic library (v0.8.1 vs required v0.54.0)
-   **Impact**: Complete failure of Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Haiku integration
-   **Models Affected**: 2 of 10 planned models (20% of test suite)

**Resolution Steps**:

1. **Diagnosis**: Web research of current Anthropic API patterns
2. **Library Upgrade**: `pip install anthropic --upgrade` (0.8.1 → 0.54.0)
3. **Code Refactoring**: Updated client initialization pattern
4. **Validation**: Confirmed compatibility with latest API specifications

**Code Changes**:

```python
# Before (v0.8.1 - broken)
anthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv('CLAUDE_API_KEY'))
response = client.messages.create(...)  # AttributeError

# After (v0.54.0 - working)
anthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv('CLAUDE_API_KEY'))
response = anthropic_client.messages.create(...)  # Success
```

### 1.3 DeepSeek API Performance and Reliability Issues

**Challenge**: Multiple issues with DeepSeek model integration affecting research reliability.

**Technical Details**:

-   **Timeout Issues**: `HTTPSConnectionPool read timed out` errors
-   **Response Quality**: DeepSeek-reasoner producing 0-78 words vs required 150-200
-   **Latency Problems**: 15-30 second response times vs 2-8s for competitors
-   **Inconsistent Performance**: Variable success rates across different prompts

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. **Model Mismatch**: DeepSeek-reasoner optimized for analytical tasks, not creative writing
2. **Server Load**: DeepSeek infrastructure experiencing high demand
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Standard prompts not optimized for DeepSeek's response patterns

**Multi-Phase Resolution**:

**Phase 1 - Timeout Optimization**:

```python
# Increased timeouts for DeepSeek's slower infrastructure
with timeout(90):  # Extended from 60s
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers, timeout=60)
```

**Phase 2 - Enhanced Prompt Engineering**:

```python
enhanced_prompt = f"""You are an expert children's story writer. Your task is to create exactly one complete story.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
- Write exactly 150-200 words (count carefully!)
- Include a clear title
- Tell a complete story with beginning, middle, and end
- Use simple, child-friendly language
- End with a positive, peaceful conclusion

{original_prompt}"""
```

**Phase 3 - Model Selection Optimization**:

-   **Removed**: `deepseek-reasoner` (poor creative performance)
-   **Retained**: `deepseek-chat` (better suited for story generation)
-   **Result**: Reduced model count from 10 to 9, improved reliability

**Phase 4 - Response Validation**:

```python
word_count = len(story.split())
if word_count < 100:
    raise RuntimeError(f"DeepSeek response too short ({word_count} words)")
```

## 2. Technical Architecture Challenges

### 2.1 Multi-Provider API Management

**Challenge**: Coordinating 4 different API clients with varying authentication, rate limiting, and response formats.

**Complexity Factors**:

-   **OpenAI**: Bearer token, JSON responses, built-in retry logic
-   **Anthropic**: Custom headers, structured message format
-   **Google**: Service account authentication, complex safety settings
-   **DeepSeek**: Basic HTTP requests, manual error handling

**Solution Architecture**:

```python
# Unified function signature pattern
def process_story_[provider](caption: str, model: str) -> tuple[str, float, float]:
    """Returns: (story_content, execution_time, cost)"""
```

### 2.2 Cost Calculation Standardization

**Challenge**: Each provider uses different pricing models and token counting methods.

**Implementation**:

-   **OpenAI**: Token-based pricing with usage metadata
-   **Anthropic**: Character-based with input/output differentiation
-   **Google**: Token-based with free tier considerations
-   **DeepSeek**: Competitive pricing with custom calculation

**Unified Cost Calculator**:

```python
class CostCalculator:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_openai_cost(response_data, prompt, model="gpt-4o"):
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_anthropic_cost(prompt, response, model="claude-3-5-sonnet"):
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_google_cost(prompt, response, model="gemini-2.0-flash"):
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_deepseek_cost(prompt, response, model="deepseek-chat"):
```

### 2.3 Error Handling and Resilience

**Challenge**: Ensuring system reliability across multiple APIs with different failure modes.

**Error Categories Handled**:

1. **Network Issues**: Timeouts, connection errors
2. **Authentication**: API key validation, quota limits
3. **Rate Limiting**: 429 errors, backoff strategies
4. **Content Filtering**: Safety blocks, policy violations
5. **Response Validation**: Format errors, length requirements

**Implementation Strategy**:

```python
try:
    story, exec_time, cost = story_function(caption)
    # Success handling
except Exception as e:
    print(f"    Error with {model_name}: {str(e)}")
    # Graceful degradation - continue with other models
    writer.writerow({
        'story_model': model_name,
        'generated_story': f"Error: {str(e)}",
        # ... error placeholder data
    })
```

## 3. Data Quality and Validation Challenges

### 3.1 Story Quality Assessment Framework

**Challenge**: Developing objective metrics for subjective creative content.

**Solution - Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**:

```python
def evaluate_story_quality(story: str) -> dict:
    return {
        'word_count': len(story.split()),
        'has_title': 'Title:' in story,
        'meets_length_requirement': 140 <= word_count <= 220,
        'contains_dialogue': '"' in story,
        'positive_tone': check_positive_indicators(story),
        'story_structure': check_narrative_elements(story),
        'age_appropriate': validate_content_safety(story),
        'bedtime_suitable': check_calming_elements(story)
    }
```

### 3.2 Response Format Standardization

**Challenge**: Different models producing varying output formats and structures.

**Standardization Requirements**:

-   Consistent title formatting
-   Uniform word count adherence
-   Structured beginning-middle-end narrative
-   Age-appropriate language validation

## 4. Development Environment Challenges

pandas==2.0.3               # Data processing
matplotlib==3.7.2           # Visualization
# ... verified working versions
```

### 4.2 API Key Management

**Challenge**: Secure management of multiple API credentials across development environments.

**Security Implementation**:

```python
# Environment-based configuration
load_dotenv()
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
anthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv('CLAUDE_API_KEY'))
genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv('GOOGLE_API_KEY'))
```

## 5. Performance and Scalability Challenges

├── Amazon Polly (neural voices)
├── ElevenLabs (custom voices)
├── OpenAI TTS (voice options)
└── Microsoft Azure (child-friendly options)
```

**Preliminary Architecture Considerations**:

```python
def process_story_tts_comparison(story_text: str) -> dict:
    """Generate audio versions across all TTS providers for comparison"""
    results = {}
    for provider, voices in TTS_PROVIDER_MATRIX.items():
        for voice_id in voices:
            audio_data, exec_time, cost = generate_tts(story_text, provider, voice_id)
            results[f"{provider}_{voice_id}"] = {
                'audio_data': audio_data,
                'execution_time': exec_time,
                'cost': cost,
                'quality_metrics': assess_audio_quality(audio_data)
            }
    return results
```
