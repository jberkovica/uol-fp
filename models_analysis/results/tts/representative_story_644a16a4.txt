The Little Robot and the Butterfly

In a cozy workshop, there lived a curious robot named Zippy. One morning, he met a colorful butterfly outside his window.

"Hello there!" called Zippy cheerfully. "What makes your wings so beautiful?"

The butterfly smiled. "Each color tells a story of flowers I've visited. Would you like to explore the garden with me?"

Zippy's eyes lit up with excitement. Together, they discovered a magical garden where roses hummed soft lullabies and sunflowers danced with the clouds.

"Curiosity opens doors to wonderful adventures," said the butterfly.

Zippy learned that friendship comes in many forms, and asking questions leads to amazing discoveries.
