The bathtub was his favorite place. ""It's like a swimming pool just for me!"" he would squeak happily, sliding down the smooth sides.

One evening, Tim noticed a new toy—a rubber duck—sitting alone by the sink, looking sad.

""Hello there! I'm Tim,"" he said, scurrying across the soft bathroom rug.

One evening, Pip heard soft crying coming from behind the bathtub. There, he found a real mouse named Whiskers who was lost and couldn't find his way home. Instead of being scared of a real mouse, Pip smiled warmly and said, ""Don't worry, I'll help you!""
