Molly wasn't just any doll; she had a special gift. Whenever someone in the family felt a bit down or lonely, Molly would magically offer a hug. One rainy afternoon, as the raindrops tapped on the window, little Emma felt bored and gloomy. She plopped onto the couch beside Molly.

Emma realized that no matter how dreary the day might seem, there was always something to be grateful for. She hugged Molly tightly and decided to draw a rainbow, bringing colorful cheer to the room.
